# Main concept of Object-Oriented Programming

## Inheritance
`The concretization` of one object can create another object. 

The concretized object has all the characteristics (methods, properties) of the original object.

## Abstraction
`The abstraction` of an object can create another object.

The abstracted object will NOT carry all the characteristics of the original object. But the abstracted object owns the primitive composition of the original object.

> In real world project, we usually use Abstraction over Inheritance


## Encapsulation
`The simplification, encapsulate the complication`

When interacting with an object, we don't need/should'n to care how that object handle data

> Encapsulation does not for security <=> Does not encapsulate data

## Polymorphism 
`The replacement` of an object by another object, MAY not change the correctness of the program. Then those two objects are two different manifestations of the same problem.

> In real world project, Polymorphism is the most used.
